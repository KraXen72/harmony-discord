# Harmony theme for Discord

**frequently updated**  
vanilla Discord but Harmony
  
**install using powercord.** https://powercord.dev
## Automatic Installation (recommended)
1. make a plain css file. name it ``main.css``  
2. put in ``powercord/src/themes/Harmony``
3. put this into your css file:  
```css 
@import url("https://raw.githack.com/KraXen72/harmony-discord/master/main.css"); 
```   
4. download the ``powercord_manifest.json`` from this repo and put it in the same folder.  
5. ``Ctrl + R`` on discord to refresh it.
6. If you want to turn the theme off or on, also switch themes, i recommend installing this plugin: https://github.com/LandenStephenss/Themer.  
7. enjoy
  
## Manual installation (if auto doesen't work)
1. do all the steps as before
2. open your ``main.css`` file in a text editor.
3. Copy the contents of ``main.css`` from github into your local ``main.css``
4. If this metod also fails, contact me on Discord: KraXen7#9190
